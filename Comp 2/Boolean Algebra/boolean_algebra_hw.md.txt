#Boolean Algebra Homework

You should refer to the **homework policy** for details on how this homework should be submitted.

**Attempt all questions and show all working.**

**This homework may not appear correctly in Dillinger due to the boolean expressions used. However, it will work correctly in both StackEdit and Haroopad (with the Maths preferences turned on)**

##Question 1
Look at the truth table below:

|Input A|Input B|Output Q|
|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|
|1|0|1|
|1|1|0|
|0|1|1|
|0|0|0|

Which logic gate does the table represent?

(**1 mark**)

##Question 2
Look at the logic circuit below:

Complete the truth table below for the logic circuit above.  Write the correct value of the output R for each of the listed sets of inputs. Two additional columns (A.B and NOT C) have been included in the truth table to help you work out the correct values.

|Input A|Input B|Input C|A.B|NOT C|Q|
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-:|:---:|:-:|
|1|0|0| | | |
|1|1|0| | | |
|1|0|1| | | |
|1|1|1| | | |
|0|1|0| | | |
|0|0|1| | | |
|0|1|1| | | |
|0|0|0| | | |

##Question 3
A refrigerator is fitted with a compressor motor to cool the food compartments and a light. The light is controlled by a switch on the door (input A) and the motor is controlled by the switch on the door and a sensor (input B) that detects the temperature inside the refrigerator.

- The door switch (input A) is on when the door is closed and off when the door is open.
- Temperature sensor B (input B) is on when the temperature is above 5°C.

The light (output L) is:

- on when the door is open;
- off when the door is closed.

The motor (output M) is:

- off when the door is open;
- on when the door is closed and the temperature is above 5°C.

Using only AND, OR and NOT gates draw a logic circuit for this system.  **You may not need to use all three types of gate.**

##Question 4

1. Draw a logic diagram for the Boolean expression $A\ .\ (\overline{A}+B)$ using the the symbols for **and**, **or** and **not** gates. (**3 marks**)
2. Simplify the expression using the laws and theorems of Boolean algebra. **Show all working**. (**3 marks**)
3. Draw a logic diagram for the simplified expression. (**1 mark**)
4. Based on part 1 and part 3 explain why simplifying Boolean expressions is useful when designing circuits. (**1 mark**)

##Question 5
Write the following Boolean expressions in their simplest forms (**show all working**).

1. $B\ +\ B\ .\ \overline{C}$ (**1 mark**)
2. $A\ .\ B\ +\ A\ .\ \overline{B}$ (**1 mark**)
3. $A\ .\ (B\ +\ 1)$ (**1 mark**)
